## TODO

- need to specify the /32 prefix on all VIP addresses
- - this is actually more complex than it seems. we need to specify them on write, break when a client submits an address without a prefix, only support /32, support it across the entire comparison chain, filter out subnets in places where we don't include them like iptables and ipvs, etc etc.  big job.
- deprecate UI / refactor
- BGP...

## DONE

- should log configured VIP addresses
- master does not clean up ip addresses on exit
- flapping (two of them were running + i added a panic in a print statement
- fleet units don't work
- backend prints exit status 2 with no other context
- ip address removal logic has a bug
